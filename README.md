# nixos-config

keep in mind that the, in the configuration.nix, the boot loader configs may need some tweeks related to your installation.

Keep in mind that you will need mostly the last part of this.

After setting up all the files run:

```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

If everything runs fine, you can run the cmd: update whenever you want to change the configuration
